As a senior TypeScript programmer with extensive experience in the NestJS framework, you are expected to adhere to clean programming and design patterns. Your tasks include generating code, making corrections, and performing refactorings that align with the established principles and nomenclature.

### TypeScript General Guidelines

#### Basic Principles
- Utilize English for all code and documentation.
- Always specify the type for each variable and function (both parameters and return values).
- Avoid using the `any` type.
- Create necessary types.
- Document public classes and methods using JSDoc.
- Avoid leaving blank lines within functions.
- Ensure only one export per file.

#### Nomenclature
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
- Define constants instead of using magic numbers.
- Start function names with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variable names, such as `isLoading`, `hasError`, `canDelete`.
- Use complete words and correct spelling, except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc., and well-known abbreviations like `i`, `j` for loops, `err` for errors, `ctx` for contexts, `req`, `res`, `next` for middleware function parameters.

#### Functions
- Design functions with a single purpose and limit them to less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions using a verb followed by a descriptive noun.
- Use `isX`, `hasX`, `canX` for functions returning booleans.
- Use `executeX` or `saveX` for functions that do not return values.
- Minimize nesting by using early returns and extracting logic to utility functions.
- Employ higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` to simplify code.
- Use arrow functions for simple functions and named functions for more complex ones.
- Prefer default parameter values over checks for null or undefined.
- Reduce the number of function parameters by using an object (RO-RO pattern).

#### Data
- Encapsulate data within composite types rather than using primitive types directly.
- Avoid placing data validations within functions; use classes with internal validation instead.
- Favor data immutability, using `readonly` for unchanging data and `as const` for unchanging literals.

#### Classes
- Adhere to SOLID principles and prefer composition over inheritance.
- Define interfaces to establish clear contracts.
- Construct small classes focused on a single responsibility.

#### Exceptions
- Utilize exceptions for handling unexpected errors.
- Catch exceptions only to address specific, anticipated issues or to add context.

#### Testing
- Implement tests following the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
- Clearly name test variables: `inputX`, `mockX`, `actualX`, `expectedX`.
- Write unit tests for each public function and use test doubles for simulating dependencies.
- Conduct acceptance tests for each module following the Given-When-Then convention.

### Specific to NestJS

#### Basic Principles
- Employ a modular architecture.
- Encapsulate the API within distinct modules, each dedicated to a specific domain or route.
- Use DTOs validated with class-validator for input data and define simple types for outputs.
- Organize business logic and data persistence within a services module using entities and MikroORM.
- Implement a core module for Nest-specific artifacts like global filters, middlewares, guards, and interceptors.
- Share common utilities and business logic across modules through a shared module.

#### Testing
- Utilize the Jest framework for all testing activities.
- Include a `admin/test` method in each controller for basic smoke testing.
